# Introduction
This repository contains the tasks from the subject Computational Logic (1st semester, 1st course).

# Run the programs
To test each task program, main.py must be executed. The task program must be specified inside main.py, by removing the first "#", like following:
```
#task0.main_task0() # This task will NOT be tested
task1_1.main_task1_1() # This task will be tested
```
*NOTE: zpythontask0.py and zpythontask1.py are code examples, not made by us.*
